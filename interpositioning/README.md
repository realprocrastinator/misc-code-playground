The purpose of this stud is to figure out how to redirect some functions in seL4 system to glibc when emulating the seL4 user application. The basic program flow is `seL4 User App -> printf(musl libc) -> seL4_DebugPutChar()`... To emulate this we will replace the `seL4_DebugPutChar()` implementation using a wrapper `printf` function of the glibc `printf`. Hence the program flow becomes `seL4 User App -> printf(musl libc) -> seL4_DebugPutChar() -> printf_wrapper() -> printf(glibc)`. But the question here is will the symbol `printf(musl libc)` conflict with `printf(glibc)`?
